  - text: I joined Kamioni at the very beginning of product development. In two years full of frequent requirements changes and bold experiments with technology stack and software architecture, together with a development team of 5 people I have developed an entire application ecosystem for digitizing the construction logistics industry. By now, the solution is already being used by thousands of trucks across multiple logistics companies and construction sites.
  - text: My main two responsibilities were to develop, maintain and test a constantly and rapidly growing, ecosystem-wide UI Component library as well as to implement core business logic on both front- and backend.
  - text: I also actively took part in use-case analysis and feature shaping. Both processes were part of our agile project management, which started as a simplified Scrum approach and through time, assisted by research, discussions and frequent feedback in the team, eventually led us to a successful adoption of the Shape Up methodology.
  - text: During my work at Kamioni, I worked primarily with: TypeScript, Vue, SCSS, Jest, Storybook,  Cypress, Firebase, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Docker.
